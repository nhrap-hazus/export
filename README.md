# Hazus Export Tool

The Hazus Export Tool summarizes Hazus risk assessment results stored on your desktop Hazus database in a handful of text files, shapefiles, and a one-page graphic report. Launch the tool by double-clicking the "hazus-export-tool.py" file in the download folder.

The Hazus Export Tool is developed using the Hazus Python Package, HazPy. HazPy tools automatically check for updates each time they are opened. Hazus Python Package documentation is found here: https://github.com/nhrap-hazus/hazus

The Hazus Export tool requires Hazus, ArcGIS Desktop, and Anaconda to be installed on your computer. Anaconda is a free software that automatically manages all Python packages required to run Hazus open source tools - including the Hazus Python package: https://fema-nhrap.s3.amazonaws.com/Hazus/Python/build/html/index.html

1. Go to https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

2. Download Anaconda for Python 3

3. Complete the installation. During installation, make sure the following options are checked:

   - [x] **Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable**
